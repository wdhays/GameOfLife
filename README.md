### About Project ###
This is a small project that I decided to work on in order to strengthen my understanding for JAVAFX,
FXML, and MVC. This project is in active development (7/18).

A list of features I would like to add.

Base Features:
- [x] click to kill/resurrect cell
- [x] wrap around game board
- [ ] save/load buttons
- [x] play/pause buttons
- [x] speed up /slow down slider
- [ ] preset patterns
- [x] ability to use different GOL rules
- [x] drag to kill/resurrect a rectangular patch of cells
- [ ] generate random pattern on grid

Future Features:
- [ ] cell age, different cell color based on age of cell
- [ ] add ability to change grid size(will probably be a predefined set of sizes)
